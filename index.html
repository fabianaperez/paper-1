    <p>After going through the first few minutes of the game walking through a forest, you suddenly come up to an edge of land and the first sight of a vast open space to the right.</p>

    <p>Example 1: Screenshot of the boy at an edge before he jumps into a boat.</p>
    <p><IMG SRC="boy at the waters edge.png"></p>
    
    <p>When I got to this moment in the game, the openess of the right side of the screen caught me off guard. Previously, we had only experienced the boy trekking through a forest like environment. This change in scenery hinted at a bigger, more diverse, environment this boy is surrounded by. 
        I feel that this scene serves the purpose of setting up the atmosphere of the game as a believable placethat could actually exist. It serves as an indicator of what is yet to come for the boy in discovering this world. 
        The "...absence of the signified, to the advantage of the referent alone, becomes the very signifier of realism..." in this situation(<i>Barthes</i>> The Reality Effect). The 'abscence' of the familiar scenery, makes the vastness and emptiness of the world feel more real. </p>
