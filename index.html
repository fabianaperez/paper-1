    <p>After going through the first few minutes of the game walking through a forest, you suddenly come up to an edge of land and the first sight of a vast open space to the right.</p>

    <p>Example 1: Screenshot of the boy at an edge before he jumps into a boat.</p>
    <p><IMG SRC="boy at the waters edge.png"></p>
    
    <p>When I got to this moment in the game, the openess of the right side of the screen caught me off guard. Previously, we had only experienced the boy trekking through a forest like environment. 
        This change in scenery hinted at a bigger, more diverse, environment this boy is surrounded by.</p>
